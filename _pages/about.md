I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at IIT Guwahati with a Minor in Electronics and Communication, fascinated by the interplay of mechanics, electronics, and control in intelligent systems. I enjoy exploring robotics and mechatronics through study, simulation, and iterative problem-solving, seeking to understand how ideas can become functional systems.
