 I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in) with a Minor in Electronics and Communication, curious about how machines sense, decide, and act. I explore robotics and mechatronics through study and simulation, seeking to understand how concepts can translate into functional systems.
